# Exercism C Track Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various exercises from the **Exercism C track**.  
The goal of this project is to practice C programming fundamentals, including functions, header/source separation, basic algorithms, and clean code structure.

Each folder contains:
- the exercise implementation in C,
- its corresponding header file,
- a small `main.c` for manual testing,
- and the exercise description.

This repository serves as a personal learning log as I improve my C skills and work through Exercism challenges.
